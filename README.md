# bouffe.github.io

This was a project created by Kate C., Maxine H., and Nola K. in the final two weeks of the 2019 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.
Initially meant to be an iOS app, then an Android app, it is now a partially-functioning website meant to help foodies with food navigation
in local areas or in unfamiliar territory.

To put things simply, it was intended to be a more advanced version of Yelp.

Several APIs were used, including Waze and Zomato, and the entire project was coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Extensive research
through the realms of Google, YouTube, Stack Overflow, and W3Schools was utilized to construct a patchwork of APIs, navigation bars, sign-in
pages, random food-related images, and text.

All in all, the project lies unfinished (for now).
